Bash Commands

Bash commands can be run by prefixing the command with ‘!’.

Cloning a git repository
!git clone [git clone url]
Directory commands !ls, !mkdir.
!ls
This command outputs the folders /content and /drive (if it has been mounted). Run the following snippet to change the current folder.

import sys
sys.path.append(‘[Folder name]’)
Download from the web
!wget [url] -p drive/[Folder Name]

Installing Libraries

Although most of the commonly used Python libraries are pre-installed, new libraries can be installed using the below packages:

!pip install [package name]
OR
!apt-get install [package name]
Upload local files

from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
Select the files for upload

For multiple files, the individual key names can be obtained by looping through the uploaded files.

for file in uploaded.keys():
  print('Uploaded file "{name}" with length {length} bytes'.format(name=file, length=len(uploaded[file])))
  
Mounting Google Drive

Run the following code.

!apt-get install -y -qq software-properties-common python-software-properties module-init-tools
!add-apt-repository -y ppa:alessandro-strada/ppa 2>&1 > /dev/null
!apt-get update -qq 2>&1 > /dev/null
!apt-get -y install -qq google-drive-ocamlfuse fuse
from google.colab import auth
auth.authenticate_user()
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials
creds = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()
import getpass
!google-drive-ocamlfuse -headless -id={creds.client_id} -secret={creds.client_secret} < /dev/null 2>&1 | grep URL
vcode = getpass.getpass()
!echo {vcode} | google-drive-ocamlfuse -headless -id={creds.client_id} -secret={creds.client_secret}
Click on the link and enter the api key.

!mkdir -p drive
!google-drive-ocamlfuse drive
Your drive is now mounted. You can use any files and folders in your drive by using the path as follows

!ls /content/drive/[folder name]
/content is the root folder of Google Colab and has to be appended to all paths used in the notebook.

Importing from existing .py scripts

Upload any existing .py scripts to a folder on drive. Consider a script ‘script.py’ uploaded to folder ‘Project’.

To import any module

import sys
sys.path.append(‘Project’)
import script 
Run an existing .py script

To run a script

!python3 /content/drive/Project/script.py
Check CPU and RAM specifications

!cat /proc/cpuinfo
!cat /proc/meminfo
Check GPU specifications

from tensorflow.python.client import device_lib
device_lib.list_local_devices()
Colab provides the Tesla K80 GPU.
